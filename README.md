# Decongestion-time-prediction-at-Railroad-Grade-Crossing
Presents a deep learning-assisted framework to estimate the decongestion time at the grade crossing
A hypothesis of the traffic behavior during the congestion event caused by passing trains is proposed. 
A deep neural network-based vehicle crowd counting algorithm is developed to estimate the number of vehicles at the normal traffic condition. 
A running average-based motion detection algorithm is designed to estimate the time of the train passing through the grade crossing. 
A regression model is then constructed to relate the quantitative information with the decongestion time.
